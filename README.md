<strong>Various AI algorithms I have written</strong>

<ul><li>OthelloBot [Java] - A Bot to play Othello (or Reversi). Uses Alpha-Beta pruning minimax with multiple weighted heuristics. (The Reversi framework does not belong to me)</li>
<li>Genetic Algorith [Java] - genetic algorithm which successfully mimics the provided picture </li>
<li>Linear Regression [Python] - linear regression class with data normalization </li>
<li>ANN [Python] - Simple artificial neural network. Provided are two example datasets, which the network can properly learn and classify</li>
<li>SlidingPuzzle [Java] - search algorithms finding a solution to a sliding puzzle. Includes A*, BFS, DFS, Iterative Deepening (The puzzle framework does not belong to me)</li>
<li>K Means [Python] - simple clustering algorithm </li>
